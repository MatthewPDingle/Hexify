That is great, but doesn't quite achieve the desired look. So scrap that and let's try something different. Each hexagonal cell is made up of concentric hexagons right? Let's try painting the concentric hexagons starting from the exterior and making our way to the inner-most hexagon. The outer-most and inner-most concentric hexagons should always be all white or all black. Let's call the outer-most concentric hexagon layer 7 and the inner-most layer 1. Layers 1,3,5,7 should always be black or white. Layers 2,4,6 are always colored. The sizes of layers 2,4,6 should be consistent from cell to cell. The sizes of layers 1,3,5,7 should vary slightly from cell to cell. The pattern of Layers 2,4,6 is made up of 2 different colors and can be described as follows.

Visualize a hexagon that is segmented into 12 distinct zones, each zone radiating outward from the central point of the circle. The zones are alternately configured in terms of their angular width: even-numbered zones (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) share identical interior angles, while odd-numbered zones (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) also share a uniform, but distinctly different, interior angle from the even-numbered zones. Even numbered zones should all be one color, and odd numbered zones another color. This configuration creates a dynamic and rhythmic visual effect, with the contrast in the angular widths contributing to the overall aesthetic of the pattern.

Lastly, let's bump up the output resolution even higher. Quadruple it. Keep the hexagonal cell sizes as they currently are. Also use 32 colors instead of 16.



Layer 1:
We are currently working on adding to the 7-layered concentric hexagon pattern within each hexagonal cell.  So far we have successfully written layer 1, which is the outer-most layer.  

For layer 2, we have to first figure out how large to make it.  Since it will be centered in the hexagonal cell, it will effectively overlap most of layer 1.  We need to figure out how much it should overlap.  Layer 2's diameter should be somewhere between 256 and 192 pixels depending on the L value of the LAB color of the desired cell.  The desired cell color is the average color of the cell area on the corresponding input image.  You used this (avg_lab) variable for choosing black or white for Layer 1.  Layer 2's diameter should scale between 192 and 256 pixels and correspond to the L value's distance from 50.  Since L ranges from 0 to 100, a difference of 50 from 50 (so either a 0 or 100 L value) should cause Layer 2 to be 192 pixels in diameter.  A difference of 0 from 50 (so an L value of 50) should cause layer 2 to be 256 pixels in diameter.  The diameter should scale linearly according to those rules.  For now, color layer 2 as red temporarily.  Layer 2 is centered within the hexagonal cell.

Layer 2:
Now that we have the correct size for layer 2,  let's stylize and color it.  Visualize this hexagon  segmented into 12 distinct zones, each zone radiating outward from the center. The zones are alternately configured in terms of their angular width: even-numbered zones (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) share identical interior angles, while odd-numbered zones (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) also share a uniform, but distinctly different, interior angle from the even-numbered zones. Even numbered zones should all be one color, and odd numbered zones another color.  Calculate the total area of the even-numbered zones and the total area of the odd-numbered zones.  (You may want to practice a sample of this math problem before implementing it code).  Choose 2 random RGB colors such that one channel is always 0, another is always 255, and the 3rd is any value ranging from 0-255.  Whichever one is closer to the desired cell color, use it to fill the larger of the even or odd-numbered zones.  Use the other color to fill the rest of the zones.  

Fix 1: 
First, Recall what I said about the layer 2 hexagon: "Visualize this hexagon  segmented into 12 distinct zones, each zone radiating outward from the center. The zones are alternately configured in terms of their angular width: even-numbered zones (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12) share identical interior angles, while odd-numbered zones (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) also share a uniform, but distinctly different, interior angle from the even-numbered zones".  Ensure that the interior angle of the even zones is different than the interior angle of the odd zones.  Since there are 12 zones (360 degrees in a circle / 12 = 30 degrees on average for each zone), make the even numbered zones have an interior angle that is a random integer between 0 and 60, and have the interior angle of the odd numbered zones be 60 minus that number.

Second, I see that you're attempting to draw the 12 zones using cv2.ellipse.  This seems to be making layer 2 into circles instead of hexagons.  This approach might work, but you may need to make the mask smaller - equal to the length between the center of the hexagon and the middle of one of its edges, not between the center and one of its vertices.  That would be sqrt(3) * 64.
